# The-analysis-of-auto-theft-cases-in-Toronto
Auto thefts have been an alarming and on-going concern in the City of Toronto. We aim to analyze data to identify any correlations that these cases may have with break-and-enter cases and various neighbourhood statistics. We have conducted an analysis using three datasets on auto theft cases, break-and-enter cases, and neighbourhood statistics. Through our analysis, we were able to generate a dashboard to provide insights on the correlations related to the number of auto theft cases, as well as predictive statistics. The analysis was divided into five major components as per below.

1.	Technique-Significant Merging/Joining of Data 
2.	Feature Engineering
3.	Predictive Modelling
4.	Visualizing data for insight generation
5.	Executive Dashboard
